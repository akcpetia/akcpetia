### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
My name is Petro. I am working as a full-stack developer since 2013. I've solved a lot of web projects on the company's website. I have my own website which is written on WP and uses phpMyAdmin DB. I prefer to use packages (functions and procedures inside) in Oracle DB and function with procedures in PHPMyAdmin. I don't prefer to write a query on the server side. I'm using KISS and DRY principles.

I have 6+ years of salesforce.com development and architecture experience in advanced administration, cross-platform integration, web integration, and workflow process design. I have also designed and built integrations between salesforce.com and PHP websites, Mailchimp, Pardot, and Marketo utilizing native integration tools as well as custom development with the Salesforce.com SOAP and REST APIs.

My technical skillsets:
- Backend: PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Python, Go, Node.js
- Frontend: Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Vue.js
- Solidity, Rust, Blockchain, Go(Golang), dApp, Ethereum blockchain, Bitcoin, ERC20 token
- eCommerce: WordPress, Shopify, Landing Page development, Wix, Magento
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, SQLite
- API: BigCommerce API, Shopify API, Xero API, REST API, Payment API, SOAP API, Twilio API
- Salesforce: Salesforce Apex, Salesforce Lightning,
- Scraping: Python, Golang, Node.js, Selenium, BeautifulSoup

I love my work. I like to have it done the right way, to have customers satisfied, and to be proud of it. Please contact me first to discuss the work and give you a quote on your job!
